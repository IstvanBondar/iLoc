iLoc 4.2
==========
- RSTT3.2.1; bugfix release
- minor bugfixes in iLoc code.
- modifications in Makefiles to support latest gcc.
- modified Makefiles to support Apple silicon compile and link issues.
- disabled option to extract local velocity model from RSTT.
- when a kml file is required, only converged solutions are written to it.

iLoc 4.1
=========
- updated the default depth grid from the rebuilt ISC bulletin, 1964-2020.
- support ISC ISF2.1 format
- introduced new instruction options, isf2.1, isf2.0 and ims
- for the isf2.1 option, station list is created from the ISC ISF2.1 file.
- ML and mB are calculated as an option due to unknown amplitude units in the
  IMS/ISF files.
- station magnitudes reported at verbose level 1.
- BEGIN and DATA_TYPE lines in the ISF2.1 output file are written only at the
  beginning of the file, not for each event.
- produce ISF2.1 file even if FixHypocenter is set.
- resolved FixEpicenter bug.
- if the magnitude phase time residual is larger than MagMaxTimeResidual its
  amplitude is ignored in the calculation of the station magnitude.
- modified Makefiles to support Apple M1 and M2 processors.
- updated the station lists.


iLoc 4.0
=========
- Incorporated the RSTT3.2 model, TT predictions and path-dependent uncertainties.
- Harmonized auxdata directory with SeisComp iLoc plugin. The stand-alone
  iLoc and the SeisComp plugin sciLoc now read the same auxdata directory.
- Moved the RSTT model to the auxdata/RSTTmodels directory.
- Added iasp91 travel-time tables.
- Jeffreys-Bullen travel-time tables are no longer supported.
- Separated model-specific and phase-specific paramaters into
  Global1DModelPhaseList.txt and IASPEIPhaseMap.txt files.


iLoc 3.3
=========
- New default depth grid calculated from the EHB and ISC free-depth events from
  the rebuilt ISC bulletin (Storchak et al., 2017, 2020) is implemented.
- Ellipticity corrections: instead of P and S, Pup and Sup is now used for Pg,
  Pb and Sg, Lg, Sb, respectively.
- Reading and station magnitude comments in the output isf file are written
  when verbose is on.
- Bug fix in iLocReadISF.c: when reading from isf file, if an event had no
  magnitude block, the previous magnitude block was copied.
- Bug fix in iLocTravelTimes.c: Incorrect indices were used in getting travel
  time table values for exact depth values when only residuals were calculated.
- Bug fix in iLocTimeFuncs.c: When fixing origin time to a value, fractional
  milliseconds were incorrectly interpreted.


iLoc 3.2
=========

- Added a new instruction, MagnitudesOnly. Invoking the MagnitudesOnly
  instruction will not locate the event, but will calculate the magnitudes
  w.r.t. the preferred origin.
- Bugfixes in the magnitude calculation of ML and mB.


iLoc 3.1
=========

- Incorporated RSTT3.1 TT predictions and path-dependent uncertainties.
- RSTT do not provide travel time predictions for direct phases when the
  source depth is below the Moho. As a result, iLoc lost the closest stations
  for deep events, thus hampering depth determination. To fix the problem,
  if RSTT does not return a valid travel time, iLoc will use ak135 predictions.
- Improved the Makefile(s).
- Renamed the etc directory to auxdata.
- The RSTT source code and model is now found in $ILOCROOT/rstt directory.
- Updated Manual.
- Minor bug fixes.

iLoc 2.1
=========

- Bugfixes.

iLoc 2.0
=========

- Adopted BSD open source license.
- Changed parameter names to CamelBack notation to facilitate easier typing
  of instructions.
- Renamed all source files and some auxiliary data files.
- Renamed the etc directory to auxdata.
- The default RSTT model is now found in $ILOCROOT/auxdata/RSTTmodel directory.
- Added usage info when iLoc is invoked without arguments.
- Before parsing text files, the occasional Windows CRLF convention is
  changed to the unix/linux/MacOS LF convention.
- Added support for the NDC-in-a-box IDC PostgreSQL database schema.
- Added support for the NDC-in-a-box SeisComp3 PostgreSQL database schema.
- Added support for the IDC Oracle database schema.
- iLoc includes and uses the Oracle open-source ODPI-C source package to
  provide the Oracle database interface.
- Slowness and azimuth measurements can now be used in location.
- For azimuth-only events the origin time is fixed.
- Infrasound I and hydroacoustic H and O phases are now used in location. The
  phase names are fixed, that is, iLoc shall not reidentify I, H or O phases.
- Introduced phase and distance dependent a priori azimuth and slowness
  measurement errors in $ILOCROOT/auxdata/iLocpars/PhaseConfig.txt.
- Removed dependency on environment variable SLBMROOT in iLocMain.c
- Improved determination of readings by taking into account author changes
  when it splits phases into readings.
- The minimum number of station magnitudes required to calculate network
  magnitudes is now a configuration parameter, MinNetmagSta. It can also be
  overridden as an instruction.
- When calculating MS from IAMS_20, units are assumed to be in nanometres.
- Introduced configuration parameters and instructions to support the
  generation of Google Earth kml, or optionally, kmz files. The configuration
  parameters KMLLatitude, KMLLongitude, KMLRange, KMLHeading, KMLTilt define
  the default view point. The configuration parameter KMLBulletinFile provides
  the pathname for the Google Earth representation of all events processed in
  one iLoc run; if a database interface is used, the KMLEventFile instruction
  generates a Google Earth file for an individual event. If the configuration
  parameter, ZipKML is set to one, the kml file(s) will be zipped into a kmz
  file, and the kml file(s) will be deleted. All Google Earth configuration
  parameters can be overridden as an instruction.
- Several bugfixes and optimizations.
- Added utilities to load station lists and IMS1.0/ISF1.0 bulletins into
  IDC Oracle and IDC NDC-in-a-Box PostgreSQL databases.
- Added $ILOCROOT/tests directory with sample input ISF files and their
  corresponding output files created by iLoc.
- Added $ILOCROOT/database directory with database schema descriptions and
  sample startup files for MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle.
- Updated Manual.

Code changes in all source files.

iLoc 1.60
==========

Introduced the computation of local magnitudes, ML and the broadband body wave
magnitudes, mB. New, mB and ML specific parameters
mB_mag_min_dist,
mB_mag_max_dist,
ML_mag_max_dist
are given in the $ILOCROOT/etc/iLocpars/config.txt file.
Phases used to compute ML are listed in the
$ILOCROOT/etc/iLocpars/ak135_model.txt file.

iLoc 1.50
==========

Replaced TT calculations from local velocity models with much simpler and
faster code. Now only the direct phase and headwave(s) are calculated, i.e.
the phases Pg/Pb/Pn/P and Sg/Sb/Sn/S. Lg is replicated as Sg. The format of
the local velocity model has also changed. The first non-comment line in
the local velocity model file is expected to be the number of layer boundaries
in the model, followed by the description of each layer in the model, i.e.
the depth of the top of the layer, its P and S velocity and an indicator
for the Conrad or Moho discontinuities.
