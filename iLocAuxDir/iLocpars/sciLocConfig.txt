# Pathname for the iLoc/sciLoc auxdata directory in SeisComp3 directory tree
#    The auxdata directory contains the directories below:
#      ak135 - ak135 travel-time tables and ellipticity corrections
#      iasp91 - iasp91 travel-time tables and ellipticity corrections
#      Flinn-Engdahl - FE regions and default depth grid files
#      topo - resampled ETOPO file for bounce corrections
#      RSTTmodels - RSTT model files
#      localmodels - local velocity model files
#      variogram - variogram model for estimating data covariance matrix
#      iLocpars - general and phase-specific configuration parameter files
#      Not used by sciLoc:
#          Stations - station coordinates
#          magnitude - magnitude attenuation files

# Local velocity model if any
#    If LocalVmodel pathname is set, sciLoc will use it to calculate travel

# Neighbourhood Algorithm
#     A grid search can be performed to obtain a better initial hypocenter
#     guess. The search is performed around the starting hypocenter.
#     For a very exhaustive search one can increase NAinitialSample,
#     NAnextSample and NAcells values. Note that max NAinitialSample is
#     around 3500 before hitting the memory limits. An exhaustive search will
#     considerably slow sciLoc down, especially when RSTT predictions are
#     enabled.
#

# Depth resolution
#     If the number of time defining first-arriving P - depth phase pairs
#         exceed MinDepthPhases OR
#     the number of local stations within MaxLocalDistDeg with a time defining
#         phase exceed MinLocalStations OR

#     the number of time defining first-arriving P and S pairs
#         within MaxSPDistDeg exceed MinSPpairs
#     then iLoc attempts for a free depth solution.
#
#     If the uncertainty in the free depth exceeds MaxShallowDepthError for
#         crustal events or MaxDeepDepthError for events in the mantle, then
#         sciLoc will reject the free depth solution and fix the depth.

#         then slowness observations will not be used in the location.
